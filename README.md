Repository dedicated to my evolution as a programmer 

Hi, I'm a teenager and I'm 16 years old from Spain, I've just started programming. 

I have opened this repository to be able to see my evolution in the world of programming. 

I will be mainly focused on languages such as: Python, C++, C, HTML and SQF (to make arma 3 mods e.g.), later I will explain the objectives I want with each language. 

## Organization

This will be organized in the following way: 

- Practices
  - C++
  - Python
  - HTML
  - C
  - SQF/Arma Scripting (later)
- Exercises
  - C++
  - Python
  - HTML
  - C
  - SQF/Arma Scripting (later)

This will obviously change as we go along, but for now this will be the initial layout

## Objectives

In each folder you will find (as I develop) an .mb or .txt file where the objectives will be commented. 

### Task list

- [x] Finish README.md
- [ ] Create all folders
- [ ] Spanish translation
